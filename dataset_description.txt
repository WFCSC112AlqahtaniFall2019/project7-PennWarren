   This dataset takes in the rate of constant maturity United States Treasuries, and derives from them leading recession indicators: yield spreads. Intuitively, the rate on longer term securities (the ten year in my data series) should be higher than short term securities (especially the three-month note). This is because of the embedded cost of expected inflation and economic growth in holding onto an illiquid asset for ten, twenty, or even thirty years.

   When short-term interest rates are higher than long-term interest rates, it indicates bad expectations for the future of the economy. In this case, investors have a negative outlook for economic growth and opt for short-term securities rather than risking their money in a long-term bond. Economic research has (at the very least loosely) tied yield curve inversions–when the spread between a long-term treasury and a short-term treasury becomes negative–to EVERY recession in the past 50 years! The Federal Reserve keeps a close eye on several yield spreads, which play a factor in their recession likelihood forecasts.

   For this reason, I have chosen to sort my data to give the most negative yield spreads first: showing the dates that we have been closest to recessions. I hope to add onto this and make it even more functional (perhaps playing into the recession forecasts) in the future. I am very interested in monetary policy: I participate in the Federal Reserve Challenge Team at Wake Forest and am considering graduate school in economics.
